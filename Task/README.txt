The stimulus is grouped into 4 groups all of them contain 3 folders inside (Front, left, right) refering to the orientation of the face. 

To run the experiment there are four lines where you need to adapt the path to wherever you place the input image. 
You need to adapt the outfile directory as well. The experiment was programmed and runs in PsychoPy3. 
Once the experiment has started and, you go beyond the two intruction screens, please press five times the letter "t" on your keyboard to start the trials. (this is a manual trigger to coordinate with the MRI scanner. Comment out the trigger section if you wish to remove that and run a behavioral experiment)
